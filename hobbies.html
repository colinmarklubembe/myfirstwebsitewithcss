    <p>This was me in 2018 when me and my family went on a trip to Dubai. I love to eat and therefore the exotic foods in Dubai. Altough I did fall sick for the first week, I really enjoyed that trip
    </p>
    <img src="images/laptop.jpg" alt="me on a laptop" style="width:350px;height:500px">
    <p>I also love to play games on my phone and laptop although I do enjoy using my laptop more. </p>
    <img src="images/playingbako.jpg" alt="me playing basketball" style="width:350px;height:500px">
    <p>Basketball is also one of my favourite pass-time activites. It helps me relax my mind after a long and exhausting day.</p>
    <img src="images/afterbako.jpg" alt="after playing" style="width:350px;height:500px">
    <p>This is me after a good game of basketball.</p>
    <img src="images/indubai.jpg" alt="me in dubai" style="width:350px;height:500px">
    <p>I also love to travel a lot. The picture above shows me at the Burj-Al-Arab in Dubai. That was when my family and I went on a two week trip to Dubai. We visited so many more places like Dubai Mall, the Qasr Al Watan Presidential Palace and so many
        more.
